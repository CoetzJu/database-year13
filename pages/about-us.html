        <p id="about-us-align">

            This website was developed by one person who wanted to create a website that will 
            help get young and old people to get interested in the idea of using Micro:bits 
            and programming. The reason why we chose to use micro:bits as the introduction to 
            programming is because the micro:bits were designed by the BBC for the education of 
            beginners and young school students. Please bare in mind we do not own the micro:bit 
            product and only provide information about them.
